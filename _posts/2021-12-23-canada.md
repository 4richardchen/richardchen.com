We've decided to move to Canada. Specifically, Markham ON outside Toronto in 2 years. We're moving because we opt for a better future for our kids as our resources enable.

We're not moving to solve for evil, bad people, problems, social troubles, those are anywhere even Canada, rather, we're making a meaningful, tangible, measurable, real improvement to our family's lives on the points which count. I'm also prosaic that general social problems like rudeness and racism are not that much different there, but the violence and social contract are much improved there. The value to us of the social contract is easiest seen in societies like the Nordics.

The tipping point after 7 years of this thought brewing were the [Oxford High School shootings](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_High_School_shooting) showed us that an affluent suburb [isn't much of a hedge against gun violence](//www.edweek.org/leadership/school-shootings-in-2021-4-takeaways-in-charts/2021/12). Sure, Brooklyn's bad and getting worse with its general crime and non-prosecution of crime which is anarchy not progressivism, but the problem is nationwide. We've not been personally touched by gun violence but I know a few who have been and we're not waiting for a day of regret based on mere hopes that it somehow won't happen. The interim stress isn't acceptable either.

Add to that the now almost customary [general violence](//www.edweek.org/leadership/violence-seems-to-be-increasing-in-schools-why/2021/11) plus possibly more worrisome yet atypical cyberbullying and bullying which school admins only want to silence to avoid jeopardizing their careers (born out of out experience with being ghosted by [PS052](//www.schools.nyc.gov/schools/K052) admins thus adding to our withdrawing our child from that school).

For most parents and ourselves included, when presented with these problems, there are 2 questions that never occur:
1. Isn't that messed up? No? Like, really, has anyone really felt this thought?
2. Can't we do better than this?

And we can do better. But that's not in this country and that's a sad truth of the situation with decreasing social decorum, dignity, respect for respect, credibility, democratic rhetoric.

We need 2 years' time to do a bunch of things including
* my professional skills and career need to be aligned as to justify a foreign such hire since the cost to the employer of legally obtaining and justifying a work visa for me is very high, probably C$15,000, thus I have to work extra hard for this such,
* add to that the legal justifications for a such hire which will be outside the control of the employer though they'll have to work to present them,
* average house price in 2021 in Markham ON is C$1.6M and so that's a thing,
* we estimate we can sustain the resources to homeschool our kids for 2y more,
* and endemic is at least that long to reach.

Citizenship is after a work visa and we won't decide on citizenship until later. It's not a blocker to the first steps.

So, we'll be busy.

Happy holidays.
